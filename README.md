# PPR-FCN
> This is the source code for the paper: [PPR-FCN: Weakly Supervised Visual Relation Detection via Parallel Pairwise R-FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01956)


### Dependencies
This code is built on top of R-FCN. Please carefully read through [py-R-FCN](https://github.com/YuwenXiong/py-R-FCN) and make sure R-FCN can run within your enviornment. 
Note: The evaluation scripts of our model are written in MATLAB. 

### Dataset/models dependencies
As discussed in the paper, we used VG and VRD as our two datasets. They can be found here: [VG](http://visualgenome.org/) and [VRD](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ranjaykrishna/vrd/).
